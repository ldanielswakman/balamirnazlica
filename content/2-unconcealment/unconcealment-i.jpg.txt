Caption: 

Unconcealment is a short film about the calling of Francesco Albano. Filmed by Balamir Nazlica in the studio of Francesco Albano unconcealment is an attempt to see through the eyes of an artist and his mood in the moment of his artistic calling. 
 
I always found the journey, the making of art interesting and I remember how Francesco had to endure painful thinking and cause a form of rapture to create Sebastian. Within the artistic rapture comes the unconcealment of a world that the artist brings from another level of consciousness. While we level down to make our daily lives livable(in a sensual way) the artist has to do the opposite-open his senses. He has to widen his senses so that he can unconceal the existing world.
