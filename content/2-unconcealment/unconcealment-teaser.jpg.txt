THE UNCONCEALMENT SERIES IS A BODY OF SHORT VIDEOS, PHOTOGRAPHS & MUSIC SOUNDTRACK ABOUT ARTISTS’ & NATURE’S DISCLOSURE

�Inspired by German philosopher M. Heidegger’s notion of truth, the Unconcealment videos attempt to exhibit artists and entities of nature unraveling their creative moments in a specific historical epoch. The short videos aim to capture the essence of the artists, and the being and time of nature by filming them in a poetic style. 
Unconcealment videos play with light, color and the moment of a disclosure by means of aesthetic cinematography. Unconcealment videos are visual poetry that is completed with the muse of music. With an additional element of cinematic compositions, Unconcealment videos open a way to a feeling of truth.
