Mehmet Aksoy is renowned also for the spiritual themes and content of his artworks, reflecting his individual sculptural imagination and metaphorical expressiveness. His works are mainly inspired by the world of shamanic rituals, spirits, mythology and nature. His main materials are stone and metal although in describing his work he states: ”we are not carving stone, we care carving light”. His works play with light, which interacts harmoniously with the sculptures to express shapes and forms.
