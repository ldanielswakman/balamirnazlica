Banner-text: Where I please. Being the first in the Irish Sea. Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck. I got a message I can't read. Im Looking Away BECAUSE! i did And you can't. Spinning around as you gaze at the sun. Rewritten by machine and new technology,. This isn't happening. Video killed the radio star.. I walk through walls. I'm not here. That's not me. What did you tell them?
