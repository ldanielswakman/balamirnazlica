Caption: 

The Unconcealment video series are short films that attempt to capture the moment of artistic inspiration of beings as such. Inspired by Martin Heidegger's use of the term, the videos are engagements of different subjects ready at hand displaying and unconcealing their self-beings.
 
To capture the seasonal change, Unconcealment 2 was shot over a period of 6 months in Cornwall, Vermont and Higgins Beach, Maine. You can watch the subtle changes of time aided with close up shots of paintings enabling you to enjoy the imaginative cosmos.
 
These films are best experienced in isolation!
